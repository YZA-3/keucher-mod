Keucher Mod is a DELTARUNE speedrun practice mod

# Installation

1. Download [the latest version of the mod](https://github.com/nhaar/keucher-mod/releases/latest). In the `assets` section, choose the patch you will use. To know what files you must use, refer to:
    1. If you are using SURVEY PROGRAM, the original version of Chapter 1 from 2018, then choose the patch starting with "survey_program_english" if you are using the English version or "survey_program_japanese" if you are using the Japanese version (this depends on which version you installed, not what language you set in the game)
    2. If you are using the default steam version (1.10), download the one starting with "demo_1.10"
    3. If you downpatched to the 1.09 version, download the one starting with "demo_1.09"
    4. If you are using the beta version 1.15, download the one starting with "demo_1.15"
    5. If you are using the beta version 1.19, download the two patches starting with "chapter1_1.19" and "chapter2_1.19"
2. Choose the ROM patcher you prefer, if you don't have any, [this one is recommended](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)
3. For each patch you downloaded, use the ROM Patcher. Make sure to:
    1. If you are in the latest 1.19 version, you will have multiple patches, one for each chapter. For the chapter 1 patch, you must patch the `data.win` inside the folder `chapter1_windows`, and the same goes for chapter 2.
    2. For other versions, which have one patch, just apply it to the data.win 
5. After you have applied a patch to a `data.win` file, you can drop it in the same folder you originally obtained the file from with the same name. Thus, it is recommended to backup your vanilla files if you wish to keep them.
